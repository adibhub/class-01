     <p style="font-size: larger;">"We want the Mujibist constitution to be buried. From the very place where the one-point movement was declared, the grave of the Mujibist <br> 1972 Constitution will be made.  We hope that the July Revolution proclamation will declare the Nazi-like Awami League irrelevant in Bangladesh,<br>" Hasnat Abdullah, convener of the Anti-Discrimination Student Movement said today.</p>

     <p style="font-size: larger;">He was speaking at a press briefing, held at the platform's central office in Banglamotor, about the announcement of the proclamation.</p>

     <p style="font-size: larger;">The Anti-Discrimination Student Movement is all set to unveil the proclamation of the July Revolution on December 31 at 3:00pm at the Central Shaheed Minar in the capital.<br>
     Hasnat said that the proclamation should have been declared on August 5, "Better late than never. The proclamation of our revolutionary uprising should have been made on August 5. <br>The delay has allowed pro-fascist forces to continue conspiring from abroad and questioning the legitimacy of the revolution through media, intellectual circles, and various other platforms. These efforts undermine the sacrifice of over 2,000 martyrs and more than 20,000 injured."</p>
